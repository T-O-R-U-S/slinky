# Slinky

A URL shortener.

# Usage

When you create a shortened link, you will be returned an ID.

You can use this ID in the `short` subdirectory to get to the website,
or you can use it in the `visits` subdirectory to see how many times it has
been used.

If you got an ID of `000`, then you would go to `<root>/short/000` to get to the shortened link.

Goto `<root>/visits/000` to see how many times the link has been used.
